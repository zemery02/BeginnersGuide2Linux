        <h3>Lesson One: Introduction to Linux</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Linux started with a man, Richard Stallman, wanting to build a completely free operating system thanks to a printer that would not allow him to modify the source code thanks to it's licenses.</li>
          <li>He had previously "hacked" otherr printers to notify users when printing was complete, as well as notify other users that the printer was free to use.</li>
          <li>Later on, a man named Linus Torvalds created an operating system that was completely free to use, and named it Linux.</li>
          <li>Later on, there was a GNU/Linux distribution named Debian, and it was sponsored by a free software organization called FSF</li>
          <li>Slowly, Debian grew from a small group of computer enthusiests, to the giant distribution that it is today.</li>
          <li>Today, there are a ton of Linux distributions based on Debian. This is possible because Debian's source code is open to the public, and can be modified and redistributed to anyone at anytime.</li>
          <li>Unfortunately, it can be kind of hard for someone just beginning to use Linux, because of how many distributions (or distros) there are.</li>
          <li>Ubuntu has been one of the most popular to use, not just for beginners, but seasoned veterans as well. Ubuntu is so popular in fact, that it has been forked many times. Forking is the process of creating
              a operating system, while using another operating system's source code as the base.
          </li>
          <li>Ubuntu's aim was to capture the stability of Debian, while releasing new versions more frequently. Now Ubuntu releases a new version every year in April, as well as in October. The naming for Ubuntu
              is year,month.
          </li>
          <li>Every two years, there is a new version of Ubuntu released that provide long-term support, called "the LTS release". LTS is supported for five years.</li>
          <li>Once you've downloaded Ubuntu, you can go ahead and download VirtualBox as well, so that you're not completely screwing up you're hard drive.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Lesson Two: Linux Distributions Explained</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>In the previous lesson, Debian was mentioned as one of the first major Linux distros, but there are three more, SlackWare, Red Hat, and OpenSuse. These are the four different types of Linux distributions.
              The types of Linux distributions are categorized by the package manager.
          </li>
          <li>As time went on, and as Debian began to grow, it started to get fork, and different versions were created by using Debian's source code as the base for all the other distributions that were created.</li>
          <li>Eventually, there Debian was forked to create Ubuntu, which was immediately forked into many different distros.</li>
          <li>There are 2 different types of Ubuntu distros, and that is, officially recognized, and unofficially recognized.</li>
          <li>Ubuntu uses what is called a Unity based desktop enviroment, can be very familiar to someone who has used Windows before. Kubuntu is an officially recognized Ubuntu fork that uses a KDE desktop
              enviroment, which is best explained by googling an image, or reffering to this lesson in the Udemy course.
